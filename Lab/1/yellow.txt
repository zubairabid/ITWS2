Getting down three floors in the same breath 
I am greeted by what is the most cheerful face 
in this sultry afternoon in OBH. For the 
uninitiated (women folk, new entrants, old 
oblivious people) – I am standing, facing a 
little corner store available to OBH residents. 
A legitimate source of envy of other hostels. 
This little yellow cubicle close to the entrance 
of the hostel was delightfully named as – yellow box.
