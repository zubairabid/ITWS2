TITLE: IISERs urge government to make them part of PMRF scheme
**************************************************

Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

The Union government’s big announcement on the new funding model for all future infrastructure development across centrally-run institutions has evoked concern among the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), The Indian Express has learnt.

Under the Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) initiative, announced in the Union budget this year, there will be no further grant-in-aid for new infrastructure in centrally-funded institutions (CFIs) such as the IITs, NITs, IIMs, IIITs and central universities. Instead, they will have to finance these projects through 10-year loans taken from the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government to mobilise funds.

As first reported by The Indian Express on February 26, a quarter of the loans on offer, that is roughly Rs 25,000 crore will be set aside exclusively for the 23 IITs. However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

**************************************************

The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************

Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

**************************************************

THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

**************************************************

The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************

On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

**************************************************

The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************

At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.

**************************************************
Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************
Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

**************************************************
THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************
On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************
At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.

TITLE: IISERs urge government to make them part of PMRF scheme
**************************************************
Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

**************************************************
The Union government’s big announcement on the new funding model for all future infrastructure development across centrally-run institutions has evoked concern among the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), The Indian Express has learnt.

Under the Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) initiative, announced in the Union budget this year, there will be no further grant-in-aid for new infrastructure in centrally-funded institutions (CFIs) such as the IITs, NITs, IIMs, IIITs and central universities. Instead, they will have to finance these projects through 10-year loans taken from the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government to mobilise funds.

As first reported by The Indian Express on February 26, a quarter of the loans on offer, that is roughly Rs 25,000 crore will be set aside exclusively for the 23 IITs. However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************
Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

**************************************************
THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************
On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************
At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.

TITLE: IISERs urge government to make them part of PMRF scheme
**************************************************
Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

TITLE: Shift from grants to loans for infrastructure has IITs worried, matter to raised during meet with President
**************************************************
The Union government’s big announcement on the new funding model for all future infrastructure development across centrally-run institutions has evoked concern among the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), The Indian Express has learnt.

Under the Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) initiative, announced in the Union budget this year, there will be no further grant-in-aid for new infrastructure in centrally-funded institutions (CFIs) such as the IITs, NITs, IIMs, IIITs and central universities. Instead, they will have to finance these projects through 10-year loans taken from the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government to mobilise funds.

As first reported by The Indian Express on February 26, a quarter of the loans on offer, that is roughly Rs 25,000 crore will be set aside exclusively for the 23 IITs. However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************
Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

**************************************************
THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************
On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************
At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.

TITLE: IISERs urge government to make them part of PMRF scheme
**************************************************
Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

TITLE: Shift from grants to loans for infrastructure has IITs worried, matter to raised during meet with President
**************************************************
The Union government’s big announcement on the new funding model for all future infrastructure development across centrally-run institutions has evoked concern among the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), The Indian Express has learnt.

Under the Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) initiative, announced in the Union budget this year, there will be no further grant-in-aid for new infrastructure in centrally-funded institutions (CFIs) such as the IITs, NITs, IIMs, IIITs and central universities. Instead, they will have to finance these projects through 10-year loans taken from the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government to mobilise funds.

As first reported by The Indian Express on February 26, a quarter of the loans on offer, that is roughly Rs 25,000 crore will be set aside exclusively for the 23 IITs. However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************
Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

**************************************************
THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************
On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************
At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.

TITLE: IISERs urge government to make them part of PMRF scheme
**************************************************
Unhappy over their exclusion, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) have urged the government to make them a part of the newly launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme that offers high stipends to students keen on pursuing research at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The matter was raised at the meeting of the President with heads of IITs, IISc and IISERs, The Indian Express has learnt.

According to government sources, IISER, Pune, had already written to the government, ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, proposing the institute’s inclusion in PMRF. In other words, the institute wants students eligible for the fellowship be able to pursue their Ph.D with IISERs as well.

The union cabinet recently approved Rs 1,650 crore for a period of seven years beginning 2018-19 for PMRF. Under this scheme, the students who in the last five years have completed or are in the final year of B.Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in science and technology streams from IISc, IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs, with atleast 8.0 CGPA, will be offered direct admission in Ph.D programme in the IITs and IISc, after going through the selection process.

Those selected will get a fellowship of Rs 70,000 every month for the first two years, Rs 75,000 each month in the third year and Rs 80,000 in the fourth and fifth years.

Although the government has taken note of the IISERs’ request, sources told The Indian Express that there may not be an immediate change in the scheme considering it was approved recently by the Cabinet.

At Tuesday’s meeting, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar announced Rs 1,000 crore for the second phase of the Impacting Research Innovoation and Technology (IMPRINT) India programme, which aims to fund solutions to engineering challenges faced by the country.

TITLE: Shift from grants to loans for infrastructure has IITs worried, matter to raised during meet with President
**************************************************
The Union government’s big announcement on the new funding model for all future infrastructure development across centrally-run institutions has evoked concern among the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), The Indian Express has learnt.

Under the Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) initiative, announced in the Union budget this year, there will be no further grant-in-aid for new infrastructure in centrally-funded institutions (CFIs) such as the IITs, NITs, IIMs, IIITs and central universities. Instead, they will have to finance these projects through 10-year loans taken from the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government to mobilise funds.

As first reported by The Indian Express on February 26, a quarter of the loans on offer, that is roughly Rs 25,000 crore will be set aside exclusively for the 23 IITs. However, the complete shift from grants assistance to loans has prompted the older IITs to express concern that the move could hurt their financial position.

Some of them are now planning to raise the issue at the upcoming meeting with the President this week, said an IIT director on condition of anonymity. President Ram Nath Kovind will meet heads of all IITs, NITs and IISERs on Tuesday in his capacity as the Visitor of all centrally-funded technical institutions.

As a first step in the direction of moving away from grant-in-aid model for capital development, the government cut its budget assistance for the IITs by almost 20 per cent, from Rs 6,326 crore (budget estimate) last year to Rs 7,856 crore (budget estimate) this year.

The concerns regarding RISE are limited to the older IITs as they, unlike the technical institutes set up between 2008 and 2014, will have to repay the whole principal amount over ten years. The interest will be taken care of by the government. The younger institutions, on the other hand, will have to repay 25 per cent of the principal amount. The balance principal and loan interest will be paid by the government.

“There are primarily three sources of income generation for an educational institution — research projects, tuition fee and alumni endowments. The problem with research funding in India is that the overhead expenditure is not paid separately to the institute. So, we don’t end up earning much from these projects,” said another IIT director, who also did not wish to be named.

“Alumni philanthropy hasn’t really picked up in India. As for tuition fee, education in the IITs is highly subsidised. That isn’t enough to generate adequate revenues to pay off loans that may run into crores,” he added.

“We don’t have a problem with the initiative, but we do want clear commitments from the government with regard to our recurring expenditure,” said the director of another IIT.

The government, however, feels the concerns are misplaced. “Some of the old IITs generate an annual revenue of up to Rs 40 crore. Under RISE, they can borrow up to 10 times the amount they escrow. The government is committed to continue funding the running expenses of all institutes such as salaries. So there is no question of the loans hurting them financially,” said a source.

TITLE: Project to flag Blue Whale Challenge victims
**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, is working on a research project that will help flag potential curators and victims of the Blue Whale Challenge — an online game which has allegedly led to deaths of many teenagers across the world.

The project, which started in September last year, is being headed by faculty in-charge Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

He told The Indian Express that the project will use the same technology that is taking lives to save lives. “The goal is to identify the victims and the curators — both of whom are using social media to connect with each other. We have found a pattern in their communication. You can see messages on social media such as ‘I want to play or add me into the game/group’ and ‘Hi, follow me if you want to play’,” he said.

Kumaraguru said the team has independently verified the number of deaths caused due to the game across the world and pegged the number at 170.

TITLE: Budget 2018: All infrastructure development in higher education to be now done only through HEFA loans
**************************************************
Centrally funded institutions (CFIs) such as IITs, IIMs, NITs, IIITs and central universities will no longer receive budget grants for expanding and building new infrastructure. Instead, all infrastructure financing will be moved to the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA), which was set up by the government last year to mobilise funds from the market and offer 10-year loans to CFIs.

According to sources, the government, on an average, was giving Rs 10,000 crore every year to all CFIs in higher education for infrastructure development. Under the new funding model, called Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE, the central universities and institutes will be able to borrow up to Rs 1,00,000 crore in the next four years.

“In terms of funds availability, it is a 250% jump,” said a senior official of the HRD Ministry, who did not wish to be identified. “The idea is to move away from lump sum grants to outcome-based approach and project-based funding. RISE will remove financial constraints imposed by budget availability and bring in greater accountability on part of the educational institutions,” he added.

Loans taken through the RISE initiative will be paid back over 10 years. There will be different modes of loan repayment for different institutions based on their internal revenues.

For instance, central universities will be eligible to borrow through the 90:10 window, which means that they will have to pitch in 10% of the actual principal amount to be repaid. The remaining principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan will be paid by the government to HEFA.

IITs and IIMs, on the other hand, will have to avail loans through the 75:25 window. In other words, they will have to give 25% of the principal amount. The balance principle and loan interest will be taken care of by the central government.

In addition to RISE, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also announced setting up of two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Guwahati and Pune this year and another 18 new SPAs will be established as autonomous Schools within IITs and NITs.

TITLE: Over 1,200 IIT, NIT graduates to teach in backward areas
**************************************************
THE HRD Ministry has recruited more than 1,200 graduates from IITs and NITs, among other institutes, to teach in engineering colleges in backward areas across 11 states. This initiative is a first of its kind as the Centre has directly intervened to address the problem of faculty shortage at institutions that are not run by it.

The new recruits will be posted in 53 engineering colleges in states such as Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They will be paid Rs 70,000 per month and the government has budgeted Rs 375 crore for their salaries, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Wednesday.

“This is the first time such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education in backward areas. With the initiative, more than one lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education,” Javadekar said.

“A public appeal was given to M Tech and PhD students from the premier institutions to work in the backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call and more than 5,000 highly-qualified persons applied,” he added.

Roughly 86 per cent of 1,225 teachers have their MTech from premier institutions such as the IITs, NITs, IISERs and IIITs.

TITLE: IIIT-Delhi working on driverless e-rickshaw to provide last-mile connectivity
**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) is working on a driverless autonomous shuttle vehicle to provide last-mile connectivity to urban Indians.

The vehicle, an electric rickshaw, would run on predefined routes. It would first shuttle between points in the university campus and in the future, provide hassle-free connectivity to modes of public transport such as Metro services.

“It will do autonomous static obstacle avoidance, lane following, read basic traffic signals, follow speed limits, and navigate through a 3D map,” Head of Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi, Mayank Vatsa, who is overseeing the project, said.

The project began in April 2016 when the artificial intelligence research centre of the institute was founded.

“Our current choice of vehicle platform is an electric rickshaw, and currently, we are working on providing shuttle service within the IIIT-Delhi campus,” Vatsa said.

Others in the team include Dr Sanjit Kaul, Dr Saket Anand, Dr PB Sujit along with Ph.d students of the institution.

To keep the cost per shuttle low, the team also plans to leverage state-of-the-art computational techniques that enables reducing the cost of sensing hardware needed for each of these vechiles.

“We are also hoping to replicate the above on Mahindra’s electric car which we received from the company as part of the Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge,” he said.

TITLE: Rahul Gandhi slams BJP on his first UP tour as Congress chief
**************************************************
On his first visit as Congress president to party bastions Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi today slammed the BJP, accusing it of continuously “lying” and not honouring its promises made to the people.

He was addressing a public meeting at Salon, which is located in Rae Bareli district but falls in his Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi.

“The BJP people are continuously lying…one lie after the other. Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads…,” the Gandhi scion said.

In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had promised that it would deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen if it came to power.

Stating that lakhs of youngsters were jobless in the country, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi never uttered a word about them.

He asked the Congress workers to “expose the lies” being propagated by the BJP.

“It is your responsibility to tell the public about the lies being said by the BJP. Also tell the people of Amethi about the various development works done by us. Whether it is related to the highways, the rail line network, the food park, the IIIT or the petroleum institute,” the Congress chief said.

He also asked the party workers to tell the people about the work done by the Congress and what had been done by the Modi government.

Referring to Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi claimed that there were 30 lakh unemployed youth in the BJP-ruled state.

“They are demanding employment, but Modi is not saying anything (about it),” he said.

“However, I want to say one thing. Come what may, the food park will be set up here (in Amethi) and I will prove this…As soon as our government is formed, whether it is the sugarcane farmers, potato farmers or farmers who grow other crops, your produce will be sold here and you will get a handsome price,” he added.

After the meeting, as the Congress president’s convoy was leaving the venue, some BJP workers raised slogans against him. A commotion ensued between the workers of the saffron party and Congress and the police had to intervene.

In the melee, Congress MLC from Rae Bareli Deepak Singh was seen engaged in a verbal exchange with Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Singh.

TITLE: Delhi: Starting July, college course on artificial intelligence
**************************************************
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi (IIIT-D) is set to start a new M.Tech programme in artificial intelligence at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, starting July 2018. The Institute will advertise for the programme in March-April.

The programme, touted to be the first of its kind in the city, will prepare students to work in the industry as well as pursue further research in the subject. The fee structure will be the same as for other courses. The Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence was set up in 2016 in partnership with Infosys, which gave a grant of Rs 24 crore. It comprises 12 faculty members.

The course will be spread over four semesters and will take in 20 students. “Usually, our experience is that it takes four semesters for students to complete the course, but it can also be finished in three semesters. We’re planning to take in only 20 students right now. But depending on how the course is received, we will decide further,” said Mayank Vatsa, head of the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

“This is a new specialisation that we’re starting apart from data engineering, security and mobile computing. It will be research-oriented and focus on foundations and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Vatsa said.

“After taking the course, students will be able to recognise and analyse problems related to AI applications, apply pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems.” Vatsa said he was also “hoping that students will get excited about the programme and want to pursue higher studies, and the programme will offer them that flexibility as well”.

IIIT-Delhi was created by the Delhi government through the IIIT Delhi Act, 2007, with the Chancellor of the institute being the Lt-Governor of Delhi.

TITLE: Express IT Awards: ‘Repeatable jobs won’t be relevant anymore, we need faster reskilling’
**************************************************
At the Express IT Awards 2017 held in Bengaluru on December 7, a panel discussion on “Future of Technology Jobs” unfolded. CXOs and experts from the industry brought in varying perspectives on the widely debated topic of automation.

Sunil Jain, Managing Editor, Financial Express, in his opening remarks highlighted how technology has the potential to change India. Edited excerpts:

How do you perceive the overall current job scenario in the Indian IT industry?

Krishnakumar Natarajan, Executive Chairman, Mindtree: Artificial intelligence, machine learning or augmented reality — are all a reality. Any quantum movement in technology will also have a significant impact on productivity. So there is certainly going to be loss of jobs, which are mainly monotonous. There would be new jobs, like customer experience specialist and data scientist.

Vishal Dhupar, Managing Director, Nvidia India: Each time a major revolution takes place, people ask the same question —what will happen to jobs? I believe there is a tremendous opportunity in the age where automation is going to be automated further.

Akhila Vasudevan, Executive Director, IBM India: We are talking about business processes led by technology and supported by people versus led by people and supported by technology in the past. Obviously, it has to have an impact and we have to accept that. It is traditional change management that will come into play. Efficiencies are going to get realised. The question is what is it that we need to do in order to reskill the workforce.

Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B: The next stage is IoT, at the micro level, and at a much larger level, there will be robots. There is going to be phenomenal opportunity. The number of jobs being created is going to be much larger than what we have seen.

Padmaja Alaganandan, Advisory partner, People and Organisation Practice Leader, PwC: The concept of a job wherein you are locked with somebody over a period of time, is already reducing and it is going to continue. Repeatable jobs will not be relevant anymore. That means skilling – not just in terms of cutting-edge new technologies but also learning about a business and its value chain.

Irfan Abdulla, Director (Talent & Learning Solutions), LinkedIn: If you look at the workforce of the future, there are three trends. First is the rise of AI. During 2014-16, jobs that required AI went up from 50,000 to 440,000. That is real and it is happening across industries.

Skill gap is a real problem. Not only in India, if you look at mature markets like the US, about 6 million jobs are there but 7.1 million people are unemployed. This shows there is a skill gap. The third point which is going to really shape the future workforce is the rise of independent workforce.

What is your perspective on reskilling?

Krishnakumar Natarajan: Skilling is going to become the priority. The skills required for tomorrow are going to be very different. The pedagogy of learning needs to change and what skills you impart to the workforce needs to change. How do you create an ecosystem to do that? We need to accelerate that process. The transition is too slow, we need to move much faster.

Vishal Dhupar: We will have to reskill the workforce because what industrial revolution allowed us to do in 70 years, may be artificial intelligence is going to give us a span of 20 years. The speed at which we can reskill is the most critical path.

Akhila Vasudevan: The next level of jobs can be created around the ability to work with cognitive computing. Most importantly AI cannot operate without content. It is very important to be able to look at content creation and to be able to ingest that into the AI systems.

Irfan Abdulla: Today, every company is a digital company, irrespective of the industry. We have seen big data picking up. A lot of people are saying that AI will take away jobs. Today, there are jobs, like IoT officer and data scientist. The average life span of skill has changed dramatically. Firms are not just focusing on the technical skills, but also soft skills. So you need creativity, adaptability and innovation. If you are looking at hiring people for today, the reality is that in two years, the skill needed will be very different.

**************************************************
NEET JEE: With an aim to provide students an opportunity to perform their best, the Lok Sabha was today informed that engineering entrance exam JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) and the national medical entrance exam, NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) might be conducted twice a year.

NTA to conduct NEET, JEE

In response to a written question in the Lower House of Parliament, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development (HRD) Upendra Kushwaha said, “The NTA will initially conduct those entrance exams which are held by the CBSE. The exams will be conducted online at least twice a year, thereby giving an adequate opportunity to the candidates to bring out their best,” Kushwaha said.

He added that the Centre was setting up a National Testing Agency (NTA), an autonomous and self- sustained premier testing organisation, to conduct the entrance exams for the higher educational institutions.

CBSE overburdened 

Both NEET for admission to medical colleges and JEE for admission to engineering colleges are currently conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The CBSE has conveyed its inhibitions to the HRD ministry about conducting the exams in future, saying they are overburdened with the massive exercise.

Clearing the JEE mains and advanced papers will give candidates access for admission to Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) courses at Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) across India.
