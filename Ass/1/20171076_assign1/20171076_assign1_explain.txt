1. the grep gets all lines >= 35, using logic: '.' matches with any character, and first match is always the beginning of the line. No matching after that because greedy. Then it matches with the next 34, total 35 minimum characters, so every line with >= 35 characters is selected. Then we execute a substituition command with in/in fact globally
in case we print everything including changes. In awk, if the line contained apathy at 3 convert to empathy, then print the line after. Grep, sed are cosmetic
get substring 1-4. And 5-forever. substitute all characters in end with *s. print start and end.
